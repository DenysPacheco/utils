minimize everything => minify html, css and js to lower download chuncks, ergo faster load

load css before js

preload => <link rel="preload" as="style" href="style.css"> ? does it works?

use defer on all js scripts
unless google apis?

defer = 'adiar' => exec after DOM rendering
async => donwload and exec async ? breaks css?

images => loading="lazy"

Image Webp
-lossless isn't good on big images (converge to bigger)

good and faster:
cwebp -q 75 -alpha_q 25 source.png -o output.web

good, but slow (doen't work on big images):
cwebp -lossless -z 9 source.png -o output.webp

better, but slower (mind big images, doesn't converge):
cwebp -lossless -m 6 -z 9 -q 100 source.png -o output.webp

better compression than peg
