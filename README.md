# Utils - utilities and common tools

This is a mono repo of utilities that I - _The Dev._ - like to have/maintain for myself.

It consists of little scripts, files and templates for a daily dev doodies.

I'm expanding this to also be a dictionary of tools that I used or like to remember.

As well as anything/any idea I make to make dev life easier.
