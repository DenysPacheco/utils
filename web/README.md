# Web things that I like to use or remember

This is a folder with web goods, tools, tips and concepts that I found it along the years, and that I like to come back to and use in my dev design days.

**This is no cake recipe. No silver bullet. It's not the rule.**

Use what you want or like, change or discard. Feel free to use however you like it 😉.
